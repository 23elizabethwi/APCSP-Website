    <p class="p">Hi, I'm Elizabeth Wiesbrock, and I am a junior in high school. I go to Piedmont High School, am 16 years old, and live in Piedmont, California. I love spending time with my friends and family, traveling, and horsebackriding. In my free time, I do robotics, play lacrosse and bake deserts. I have three older siblings, one in college and two who have already graduated, and a pet fish.</p>
